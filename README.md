# IoT-Based Robot for Medical Assistance and Teleconsultation 🤖🏥

This project is a comprehensive IoT solution designed to assist healthcare institutions with **remote patient interaction**, **teleconsultation**, and **automated triage** using a mobile robot. It enables real-time doctor-patient engagement and streamlines hospital operations through RFID-based patient tracking and scheduling.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The system includes:

- An **Arduino-powered mobile robot** for navigating hospital wards.
- **RFID-based triaging system** integrated with hospital databases for automated patient evaluation and appointment scheduling.
- **Dynamic telepresence** capabilities allowing doctors to remotely control the robot and conduct consultations in real time.
- A **Flutter-based mobile application** for patients to interact with the robot and receive care.
- A **web portal** for doctors to monitor, evaluate, and consult patients through a live video feed.
